Class Meeting Times
-------------------
**Lecture:** MWF 1:30--2:20pm Keller 403

Overview, Prerequisites, Outcomes
---------------------------------

**Course Description** (from the catalog)  
Formal introduction to the concepts of logic, finite and infinite sets,
functions, methods of proof and axiomatic systems. Learning mathematical
expressions in writing is an integral part of the course. 

This course emphasizes the reading and writing of mathematical proofs.
We will cover chapters most of Chapters 1 through 6
of [the textbook](#textbook).

**Prerequisites**  
Prerequisites: 243 (or concurrent) or 253A (or concurrent), or consent. 

**Learning Outcomes**  

Students will gain proficiency in reading and writing proofs, as well as solving
computational problems, concerning the following topics:


See the list of [Course Objectives](#course-objectives) below for more details.

Textbook Information
--------------------

**Title:** 
[Book of Proof](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0989472108/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0989472108&linkCode=as2&tag=typefunc-20&linkId=a7cebb94d6c832b84c985f6b6dcc771b)

    </iframe>
	
It is helpful (but not mandatory) to have a hard copy of the textbook.  Students
should at least have access to an electronic version of the book, or
a comparable book. It may be possible for some students to get by
with just the lecture notes, but that is not recommended.

*Please note: shipping delays or other problems that may arrise
when trying to find a cheaper copy of the textbook do not constitute a valid
excuse for failing to submit homework on time.*


Exams
-----
There will be two midterm exams each worth 20%, and a final exam worth 30% of the course grade.

+ **MIDTERM EXAM 1** (focus on Chapters 1 and 2)  
**DATE:** Friday, February 19 (subject to change)  
  
+ **MIDTERM EXAM 2** (focus on Chapters 3 and 4)  
**DATE:** Monday, April 4 (subject to change)  

+ **FINAL EXAM** (focus on Chapters 1--6 and Section 7.1)  
**DATE:** Monday, May 2, 2016  
**TIME:** 12--2pm   
**LOCATION:** Carver 0132

The final exam will be cumulative, that is, it will cover everything we have
learned during the semester.

In accordance with university policy, the final exam is mandatory and must be
taken by all students at the scheduled time. Do not make travel plans before
the date of the final exam.


Homework
--------
**Late homework will not be accepted or graded.**  

Solving lots of problems is the best way to prepare yourself to do well on the
tests, and ultimately to do well in the course.

The **homework will account for 25% of the course grade** and will be
assigned once per week, typically due each Friday **at the beginning of class.**
You must submit a hard copy of your homework.  Electronic documents
(e.g., email attachments) are not acceptable.

Homework submitted at the end of class on the due date will be penalized
10%. **Homework submitted after then end of class on the due date will not be
accepted or graded.**  

At least one (possibly more) of the lowest or missed homework scores
will be dropped and not counted toward the final course grade.
*The 10 best homework scores will count toward the final grade.*

The last homework assignment will be due during the last week
of the semester, also known as "dead week."  

Computer Lab
------------
Four of the Friday class meetings will be held in the Computer Lab on the
fourth floor of Carver in Room 449.  Specifically, we will meet in the
Computer Lab (instead of our usual classroom) on the following dates:

**January 29, February 12, March 25, April 15**

The Computer Lab component is worth 5% of the final course grade.

Students are required to show up for each computer lab, login to a
computer, and register for (or sign-in to) an account on the Math Department's
Sage server.  Doing so earns the student one percentage point
(per lab). Students can then earn one additional point (per lab) by completing
that day's lab assignment *during that day's lab period* (from 1:10 to 2pm).
Lab assignments must be completed on the day they are assigned.
**No late lab assignments will be accepted.**

Thus, there is a total of 8 Computer Lab points available over the course of 
the semester.  Since the computer lab component accounts for just 5% of the course
grade, this means there is a possibility of earning 3 extra credit points by
completing all of the Computer Lab assignments.  On the other hand, if a student
merely shows up to each Computer Lab session and signs on to their account,
but does not complete any of the computer assignments, then that student will earn
4 out of 5% for this component of the course grade.


Make-up Policy
--------------
**No late homework will be accepted for any reason.**  If you fail
to submit homework on time, this will not necessarily hurt
your course grade since the lowest homework scores will be dropped.

Generally speaking, there are no make-up exams. However, 
if you must miss an exam for one of the legitimate reasons listed below,
and if you contact the professor at least five days before the exam date,
then you might be able to take a make-up exam *before* the scheduled exam time.

To request a make-up exam, a student must provide documented evidence of
one of the following:

+ Medical excuse - student's own medical emergency.
+ Medical excuse - a member of the student's family has a medical emergency.
+ Extra curricular activities as a representative of Iowa State University.
+ Armed forces deployment (military duty).
+ Officially mandated court appearances, including jury duty.
+ A conflict with another exam or if you have three or more final exams on a
given day.  (In each case the exam with the fewest students
must arrange the make-up exam.)

If you miss an exam due to some unforeseen circumstance, you must contact the 
professor within one class meeting after the missed test and provide an
explanation. If your excuse is accepted, the missed test score may be replaced 
with 80% of your final exam score. For example, if your excuse is accepted and
you score a 90% on the final, then you will receive a 72% for the missed test
(0.80*0.90 = 0.72).


Grading Policy
--------------
The breakdown of the final course grade is as follows:  

+ Final exam: 30 points  
+ Mid-term exams: 40 points (20 each)  
+ Homework: 25 points total  
+ Computer Lab: 5 points total  

At the end of the semester, letter grades will be assigned roughly according to
the following table. However, the scale may be shifted,
depending on overall student performance.  All curving (if any)
will occur at the end of the semester.  

+ A: 94--100  
+ A-: 91--93  
+ B+: 87--90   
+ B: 84--86   
+ B-: 81--83   
+ C+: 77--80  
+ C: 74--76   
+ C-: 71--73   
+ D+: 67--70   
+ D: 64--66   
+ D-: 60--63   
+ F:  0--59    

Attendance
----------
Students are expected to attend all classes.
A grade penalty will be exacted if you have an excessive number of absences
(whether excused or unexcused).
Specifically, you are permitted (but strongly discouraged from taking) **seven**
absences in total, and you must
<a href="mailto:williamdemeo@gmail.com?subject=MATH 317:
(fill in subject here)&amp;body=Dear Dr. DeMeo, (your message) Sincerely, (your full name)">email
the instructor</a>
if/when you must miss a class.
Each additional absence, and any absence not mentioned to the instructor,
may result in the deduction of points from your final grade.

Occasionally attendance will be recorded by passing around a sign-in
sheet on which you will print and sign your own name. If another student asks
you to sign in for them, don't do it! Forging another student's signature
constitutes a violation of the student code of conduct and will be referred to
the ISU Office of Judicial Affairs.

**Important:** If you plan to leave before class is over, the correct procedure is to mention
this to the professor before the start of class. It is impolite and disruptive
to your classmates to leave, or even pack up your belongings, before the lecture
is over.


Asking Questions
----------------

When you don't understand something, please ask a question!

1. **In Lecture.** The best time/place to ask a question is during lecture or recitation or office hours.

2. **On Piazza.** Another good place to ask a question is the online discussion
   forum.
   This term we will be using [Piazza][] for class discussion and all students
   should enroll in this forum by visiting the [Piazza signup page][].

   This system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from
   classmates, the TA, and the professor. Rather than emailing questions to the
   teaching staff, students are encouraged to post questions on Piazza forum.
   If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email
   [team@piazza.com](mailto:team@piazza.com). 

   Our class Piazza page is at: https://piazza.com/iastate/spring2016/math317/home


Email Policy
------------
You may email the instructor directly, though the response
time will generally be slower than if you use one of the preferred methods
described above.

If you email the instructor, you *must* use an informative subject field.
If you use <a href="mailto:williamdemeo@gmail.com?subject=MATH 317:
(fill in subject here)&amp;body=Dear Dr. DeMeo, (your message) Sincerely, (your full name)">this
link</a>  to email the professor, then some of the required information should
pre-populate your message fields.  If you do not at least
indicate which class you are in, your email may be ignored.


Use of Electronics During Lecture
---------------------------------
Silence and refrain from using all electronic devices (phones, ipods, tablets,
microwave ovens, etc.) during class and exam periods.
Using a computer during lecture to check Facebook, for example, is totally
unacceptable. Besides how this affects your own ability to focus on what is
being taught in the lecture, computers can be very distracting to other
students. **Use of electronic devices in lecture for purposes unrelated 
to math will not be tolerated.**


Academic Honesty
----------------
Cheating is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. Violations of this policy
will be referred to and dealt with by the ISU Office of Judicial Affairs, in a
manner consistent with university regulations, which range from a warning to
expulsion from the university.


Classroom Policy
----------------
In this course, we follow the general university classroom policy:
http://www.math.iastate.edu/Faculty/ClassPolicies.html


Students With Disabilities
--------------------------
If you have a documented disability
or if you believe that you have a disability that qualifies under the
Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act and requires accommodations, you should contact the Student Disability
Resources Office for information on appropriate policies and procedures.

**The Disability Resources Office**  
Student Services Building, Room 1076  
phone: 515-294-6624, or 515-294-7220, or TDD 294-6335  
email: [disabilityresources@iastate.edu](mailto:disabilityresources@iastate.edu) or
[accommodations@iastate.edu](mailto:accommodations@iastate.edu).

You must obtain a Student Academic Accommodation Request (SAAR) from the Disability
Resources office and you must contact your instructor early in the semester so
that your learning needs may be appropriately met. 

Your instructor will be happy to assist with accommodations, but will not
provide them retroactively, **so the appropriate requests and paperwork 
should be filed well before the first exam.**

More information about disability resources in the Mathematics Department can be
found at http://www.math.iastate.edu/Undergrad/AccommodationPol.html.
